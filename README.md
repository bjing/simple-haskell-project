# Simple Haskell Project Template
This is a simple Haskell project template for you to start a new project from scratch right away.

The project uses [Haskell Stack] as the build tool.

## Dev environment
You can set up a local dev environment by using [GHCup](https://www.haskell.org/ghcup/).

Or you can use a [Docker dev container](https://github.com/bjing/haskell-dev-container) that I created to get into
action right away.

## Instructions
Please update the GHC Stack snapshot version in [stack.yaml] before building your project. Go to [Stackage](https://www.stackage.org/) to find the 
version you need.

A cabal file will get auto-generated by the project. Please DO NOT edit the cable file manually.
Project related configrations should be updated in [stack.yaml](stack.yaml) and [package.yaml](package.yaml).

### Build commands
Build:
```sh
stack build
```

Test:
```sh
stack test
```

### Run a single file
```
stack runghc <file-path>
```

### Load a file into REPL
Start the REPL
```
stack ghci
```

Within the REPL prompt

```
:l <filepath>
```

### Formatter
[Stylish-haskell] is recommended.

To install it:
```sh
stack install stylish-haskell
```
